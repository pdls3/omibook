Delete Local Branch

As stated in the question above, I successfully deleted a local branch using:

$ git branch -d branch_name
Note: The -d option is an alias for --delete, which only deletes the branch if it has already been fully merged in its upstream branch.
You could also use -D, which is an alias for --delete --force, 
which deletes the branch "irrespective of its merged status." [Source: man git-branch]

Delete Remote Branch [Updated on 1-Feb-2012]

As of Git v1.7.0, you can delete a remote branch using

$ git push origin --delete <branch_name>
